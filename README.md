# Social-Distancing-Detector
Computer vision has opened up a lot of opportunities to explore into AI domain that were earlier highly limited. Here is an application of haarcascade classifier and OpenCV to develop a social distancing violation detector. I am passing the algo through a video feed where it first detects people using 'haarcascade_fullbody.xml' classifier algo. OpenCV and some mathematical operations then allow us to make code the social distancing violation logic
